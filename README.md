- 👋 Hi, I’m @lrolofson
- 👀 I’m interested in all things that go bleep and bloop.
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself to build responsive, graceful web pages (catch me on codepen as some-user).
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate on something that helps me build my skills but isn't critical because I am still a wee babby programmer.
