Hi, I'm Leland Rolofson. I'm interested in all things that go bleep and bloop. 

Right now I code as a hobby. I've screwed around with Python, JavaScript, and C (via Arduino and PlatformIO). I've also enjoyed programming in video games, like TIS-100, Shenzhen I/O, and Kerbal Space Program (via kOS).

Doing it as a hobby is fine, but at some point I'd like to do it for money. To that end I've taken a break from projects to focus on learning how to think about software more effectively so I can write software that's actually good. Right now I'm working my way through *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin. 

If you're looking for a collaborator that's open to criticism and eager to learn, I'm your guy. If you're looking for a pro, I'm not your guy. Yet.
