Hi, I'm Leland Rolofson. I'm interested in all things that go bleep and bloop. Right now I code as a hobby, but at some point I'd like to do it for money. To that end, I'm learning JavaScript (catch me on codepen as @some-user), but I've recently taken a break from projects to focus on learning how to think about software more effectively so I can write sofware that's actually good. Right now I'm working my way through *Clean Code* by Robert C. Martin. If you're looking for a novice collaborator that's open to criticism and eager to learn, I'm your guy.
